# ReardonSegregationIndex
Provides utilities to calculate the ordinal segregation index presented in Reardon (2008): "Measures of Ordinal Segregation"

Imagine you have data on income brackets or education levels of a population and you want to measure how segregated is the population in subgroups
 (say, schools or neighborhoods)

In this situation, this measure has two advantages over the often used [Duncan Segregation Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Segregation_Index):

1. It doesn't require you to make an arbitrary split on poor/rich, uneducated/educated; you can just use the multiple categories you have
2. It takes into account the ordered nature of the categories.
